# Google Homepage
This is my first project as part of The Odin Project. As the name of the project suggests the goal is to style a page that replicates
 the homepage of Google as closely as possible. Since it is my first time trying to style a professional-looking webpage, I had to use
 some less-than-ideal hacks to position elements in the place where I wanted them. The project is not yet complete, but I plan on returning
 to it in the coming weeks to fix the parts I am unable to right now as I continue to work my way throught the Odin Project.
